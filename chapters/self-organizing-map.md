# Understanding Self-Organizing Map: Definition, Explanations, Examples & Code

The Self-Organizing Map (SOM), also known as Kohonen map, is a type of
artificial neural network trained using unsupervised learning to produce low
dimensional representation of the input space. It is an instance-based
algorithm that falls into the category of unsupervised learning methods, where
the network learns from unlabeled data. The SOM algorithm is commonly used for
tasks such as data visualization, clustering, and feature extraction.

## Self-Organizing Map: Introduction

Domains | Learning Methods | Type

The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network that is
trained using unsupervised learning to produce low dimensional representation
of the input space. The SOM algorithm is an instance-based approach that maps
high-dimensional input data onto a low-dimensional grid, preserving the
topology of the input space.

The SOM is a powerful tool for data visualization, clustering, and feature
extraction, and has been successfully applied in a wide range of fields,
including image and speech recognition, data mining, and bioinformatics. The
unsupervised learning method used in SOM allows for automatic detection of
patterns and relationships in the input data without the need for explicit
labels or classifications.

With the ability to handle large datasets and identify complex patterns, the
Self-Organizing Map has become a popular and widely used algorithm in the
field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Through the use of SOM, engineers and researchers can gain valuable insights
into the underlying structure and relationships within their data, leading to
improved decision-making and problem-solving.

Unique Features of Self-Organizing Map

One of the unique features of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is its ability to maintain the topological properties of the input data. This means that the SOM not only groups similar data points together but also arranges these groups in a way that reflects their relationships in the original high-dimensional space. This is particularly useful for visualizing complex, high-dimensional data in a way that preserves the inherent structure and relationships within the data.

Another unique feature of SOM is its flexibility. The size and shape of the map can be adjusted to suit the specific requirements of the task at hand, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, the SOM algorithm is robust to noise and missing values in the data, which makes it a practical choice for real-world data analysis tasks.

Finally, unlike many other machine learning algorithms, SOM provides a visual output that is easy to interpret, even for those without a technical background. This makes it a valuable tool not only for data scientists and machine learning engineers, but also for business analysts, decision-makers, and other stakeholders who need to understand and make use of complex data.

## Self-Organizing Map: Use Cases & Examples

The Self-Organizing Map (SOM), also known as Kohonen map, is a type of
artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised learning to
produce low dimensional representation of the input space. It was invented by
Teuvo Kohonen in the early 1980s.

SOM has a wide range of use cases, including:

  * Image and signal processing: SOM can be used for image and signal compression, feature extraction, and image segmentation.
  * Data visualization: SOM can be used to visualize high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space, making it easier to explore and understand.
  * Clustering: SOM can be used for clustering similar data points together in the low-dimensional space.
  * Recommendation systems: SOM can be used to classify and recommend items based on user behavior or preferences.

## Getting Started

The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network that is
trained using unsupervised learning to produce low dimensional representation
of the input space. It is also known as Kohonen map, after its inventor Teuvo
Kohonen. SOMs are instance-based and can be used for clustering,
dimensionality reduction, and visualization of high-dimensional data.

To get started with SOM, you can use the MiniSom package in Python. MiniSom is
a minimalistic and Numpy-based implementation of the SOM algorithm. Here's an
example of how to use MiniSom to cluster a dataset:

    
    
    
    import numpy as np
    from minisom import MiniSom
    
    # create a dataset
    X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    
    # create a SOM with a 5x5 grid
    som = MiniSom(5, 5, 10, sigma=1.0, learning_rate=0.5)
    
    # train the SOM on the dataset
    som.train_random(X, 100)
    
    # get the cluster labels for each data point
    labels = som.labels_map(X)
    
    # print the cluster labels
    print(labels)

## Self-Organizing Map: ELI5

The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is like a detective that looks at all the clues
and figures out how to group them together. It's a type of artificial neural
network that can learn on its own without someone telling it what to do. Using
unsupervised learning, SOM can take a large amount of data and find patterns
within it, creating a low dimensional map that represents the important
features.

Imagine you're moving into a new house and you have a lot of boxes to unpack.
You start by organizing the boxes into groups based on where they should go in
your house. The SOM algorithm does something similar. It takes a big pile of
data and sorts it into groups based on similarities between the data points.
Then it creates a map that helps visualize those groups so you can see how
they relate to each other.

SOM is great for data visualization, pattern recognition, and data
compression. It helps us understand complex data by simplifying it and
allowing us to look at it in a more manageable way.

If you're interested in learning more about artificial neural networks, SOM is
a great place to start.

Key takeaways:

  * The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an instance-based algorithm that uses unsupervised learning to create a low dimensional map of a large dataset.
  * It works by grouping together similar data points and creating a visual representation of those groups so we can better understand the patterns in the data. 
  * SOM is useful for data visualization, pattern recognition, and data compression.
